================================== 
Github
flexible location to share your "clean" notes.
Especially for Sharing.
Sync with VSCode, GitHubDesktop, git push/pull.
Update manually (what I often end up doing).
Easy 'clone' to download.
Owned by Microsoft.
"Could" be great for teams to share docs, but many hurdles.
